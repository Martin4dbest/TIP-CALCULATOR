                    <p>The tip calculator is a useful tool for everyone who goes out to a restaurant, bar, or anywhere else you are supposed to tip. If you have ever had a problem figuring out how much to tip, read on. We also cover the topic of tip definition and explain to you how to calculate a tip by yourself, as well as teaching you how to use our gratuity calculator.</p>

                    <h3>Tip definition</h3>
                    <p>A tip is a small amount of money that we give to someone who provided us with a certain service as an additional way of expressing our gratitude. Apart from this, we normally also pay the stated price for the goods and services we receive. Nevertheless, this money usually goes to the owners of the facilities and firms that we visit, not to the person that serves us.<strong>Places in which we tip the most are, without a doubt, restaurants, cafes, taverns and other places linked to gastronomy.</strong> We tip bartenders for preparing our alcohol drinks, baristas for providing us with caffeine-rich coffee and waitresses for taking our orders and bringing food to our tables. Other facilities whose employees count on our tips are hotels and hostels. We may tip hotel porter that carries the luggage to our room, maids that clean our room after or during our stay, and hotel room service personnel that brings food or a bottle of champagne ðŸ˜‰ up to our room.</p>
                    <p><strong>However, there are many other situations and places in which we may, or even should, tip.</strong> Tour guides often make a living from the tips that they receive. Pizza (and other food) delivery boys may deserve a tip after driving to us in the rain and late at night. We can show our gratitude to hairstylists, barbers, and cosmeticians for making our hair, beard, and nails. Finally, we can pay taxi drivers some extra money for driving us from one place to another or waiting for us for a long period. There is an option to tip in the Uber app, as well.</p>

                    <h3>How to calculate a tip? <br/> Choosing a tip percentage</h3>
                    <p>If you want to find out how to calculate a tip, you need to decide how much you appreciate the service. <strong>There is an unwritten rule that a tip should be between 10% and 20% of the total value of the bill.</strong> It may be hard to imagine somebody sitting at the restaurant table and calculating the percentage of the bill, but there is a relatively easy way to do it. When you want to count 10% of your bill, it's quite simple. You need only move the decimal point to the left by one. If you wish to leave a 20% tip, you just have to multiply the 10% value by two. In the event you want to leave a 15% tip, it is easier first to figure out a 10% tip and then add half of that value again. Now, let's do it together:</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your bill is $120.80.</li>
                        <li>10% of the total - we have to move the decimal point one space to the left: $120.80 -> $12.08</li>
                        <li>20% of the total â€“ we need to take the value of 10% and double it: 2 * $12.08 = $24.16</li>
                        <li>15% of the total â€“ we have to divide the value of 10% by 2 and then add the result to the value of 10%: ($12.08 / 2) + $12.08 = $6.04 + $12.08 = $18.12 .</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>Pretty easy, isnâ€™t it? Now, letâ€™s deal with another example to make sure that this trick will stay in your head for a longer time:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The value on your bill is $66.40.</li>
                        <li>10% of the total â€“ moving the decimal point one space to the left: $66.40 -> $6.64</li>
                        <li>20% of the total â€“multiplying the value of 10% by 2: $6.64 * 2 = $13.28</li>
                        <li>15% of the total â€“ dividing the value of 10% by 2 and then adding to the value of 10%: ($6.64 / 2) + $6.64 = $3.32 + $6.64 = $9.96</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>If you already know how to calculate a tip, it's high time you found out what the tip calculator is.</p>

                    </div>

                </div>
